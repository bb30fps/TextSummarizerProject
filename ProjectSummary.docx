Project Overview ::

This is an advanced text summarization tool that combines traditional NLP techniques with modern AI along with OCR functionality.

>>>>>

Libraries::

- GUI: tkinter with ttk for modern widgets
- NLP:
  - nltk (tokenization, stopwords, frequency analysis)
  - transformers (Hugging Face pipelines)
- Document Processing:
  - docx (Word documents)
  - pdfplumber (PDF extraction)
- Computer Vision:
  - OpenCV (image preprocessing)
  - pytesseract (OCR integration)
  - PIL/Pillow (image handling)
- ML Framework: torch (PyTorch backend for Transformers)

Core Algorithms & Techniques:
1. Extractive Summarization:
   - NLTK-based sentence scoring using:
   - Word frequency analysis (FreqDist)
   - Positional bias weighting
   - Randomization for diversity
   - Contraction expansion for better processing

2. Abstractive Summarization:
   - BART-large-CNN model from Hugging Face Transformers
   - Beam search with temperature (0.85) and top-k/top-p sampling
   - Length-constrained generation with repetition penalty

3. OCR Processing:
   - OpenCV image enhancement pipeline:
   - Denoising (Non-local Means)
   - CLAHE contrast enhancement
   - Adaptive thresholding
   - Sharpening filter
   - Tesseract OCR with custom config

Unique Differentiators::

1. Multi-Format Input Support:
   - Text files, Word docs, PDFs, and images (JPEG, PNG, BMP)
   - OCR text extraction with image preprocessing

2. Hybrid UI Controls:
   - Dynamic UI switching between extractive/abstractive modes
   - Interactive image preview with OCR results
   - Progress tracking for long operations

3. Advanced Text Processing:
   - Contraction handling (100+ contractions supported)
   - Summary length control:
   - Sentence count for extractive
   - Word limit for abstractive
   - Post-processing for grammatical correctness

4. Performance Optimizations:
   - CUDA acceleration for transformer models
   - Intelligent sentence selection with diversity factors
   - Memory-efficient image preview handling
