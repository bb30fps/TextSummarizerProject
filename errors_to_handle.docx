Dependency Installation  (if needed)
pip install torch transformers python-docx pdfplumber nltk

---------------

1.
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tkinter (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tkinter

Solution- 

This error occurs because tkinter is not a pip-installable package - it's part of the Python Standard Library.

1. Remove Tkinter from your `requirements.txt` file.

Correct requirements.txt

nltk
python-docx
pdfplumber
transformers
torch

Now verify :: Check if Tkinter is properly installed by running:

python -m tkinter (Should open a test window if installed correctly)

2.
from transformers import pipeline
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'transformers'

Solution - 
This error occurs because the Hugging Face `transformers` library isn't installed.

Steps:

1. Install Required Packages :

pip install transformers torch sentencepiece

2. For CPU-only Systems:

pip install transformers[torch]

3. For Better Performance (GPU):

pip install transformers torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117

Now verify,
Test the installation in Python console:

from transformers import pipeline
print(pipeline('summarization')('Test input'))  # Should return a summary

Still getting errors, try:

pip install --upgrade transformers


---------------

3.
    import torch
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'

Solution - 

This error occurs because **PyTorch** (required by the transformers library) isn't installed.

Installation:

1. CPU

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

2. GPU

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

Now verify, after installation:

import torch
print(torch.__version__)          #shows version
print(torch.cuda.is_available())  #returns True if GPU is available
