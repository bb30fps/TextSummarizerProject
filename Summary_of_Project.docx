Project Overview ::
This is an advanced text summarization tool that combines traditional NLP techniques with modern AI to:
- Process multiple file formats (TXT/DOCX/PDF)
- Dual summarization modes: Extractive & Abstractive
- Provide a user-friendly GUI with real-time feedback

>>>>>

Libraries::

-File Handling - python-docx, pdfplumber 
-NLP Processing - NLTK, spaCy (indirect via transformers) 
-Deep Learning - Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch 
-GUI - Tkinter, ttk 

Key Algorithms
Extractive Mode:
- NLTK-based sentence scoring
- Frequency distribution analysis
- Contraction mapping
- Randomized sentence selection

Abstractive Mode:
- Google's Pegasus-XSum transformer model
- Creative generation parameters:
  - Temperature sampling (0.8)
  - Top-k & Top-p sampling
  - Repetition penalty

>>>>>

Unique Differentiators::

1. Multi-Format Support
   - Handles PDF/DOCX/TXT seamlessly
   - Preserves formatting during extraction

2. Hybrid Approach
   - Switch between extractive/abstractive modes
   - Combined frequency analysis + neural generation

3. Creative Abstractive
   - Custom temperature/repetition settings
   - Post-processing for readability
   - Novelty-focused generation

4. User Experience
   - Progress visualization
   - Error-resilient design
   - Auto-adjusting summary length

Implementation Challenges Solved

1. Format Preservation
   - Unified text extraction from PDF/DOCX

2. Usability
   - Auto-scaling GUI elements
   - Context-sensitive help
